# upworks_jobs_scrap_keywords_frequency

Using this script we can make word frequency statistics of keywords in upworks job search

This can then be used to find out the skills that are mentioned with more frequency

In the upworks_url variable please set the url of the upworks rss feed, you can get this by going to "FIND_WORK" in upworks and getting the RSS feed link

The program saves the statistics in a json file and also an ignored keyword list, so with time if you keep adding to the ignored list, the results will become more accurate
